# load needed driver
sudo modprobe can
sudo modprobe can_raw
sudo modprobe can_bcm
sudo modprobe vcan  (for virtual can)

# for "real" devices
sudo modprobe ...
sudo modprobe can_dev (needed for netlink -> needed ip/ipconfig)

#
# setup vcan0
ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
ip link set up vcan0

# delete vcan0
ip link set down vcan0
ip link delete dev vcan0 type vcan

#
# setup "real" device
ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 triple-sampling on
ip link set up can0

# delete "real" device
sudo ip link set down can0
sudo ip link delete dev can0 type can (-> cause to crash the system on PEAK box!)
